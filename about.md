# About me

My name is Aulia Khalqillah. Iâ€™m a researcher at the Geological Hazards Division in [Tsunami and Disaster Research Center (TDMRC)](https://tdmrc.usk.ac.id/),
Universitas Syiah Kuala (USK), Banda Aceh. My fields are Seismic Hazard-Risk Analysis, Microtremor Data Analysis, and Computational Seismology,
all related to earthquake science. I study the earthquake from physics and statistics perspectives to understand behavior of an earthquake more comprehensively.

# Software or Open Source Code

- [SVIM - Seismic Vulmnerability Index of Microtremor](https://github.com/auliakhalqillah/SVIM) : The tools to conduct microtremor data processing by implementing Horizontal to Vertical Spectral Ratio (HVSR) method. This app will calculate a seismic vulnerability index ({% latex %} K_g {% endlatex %}) and visualize an initial spatial map directly. This was built using MATLAB.
- [hvcheck](https://github.com/auliakhalqillah/hvcheck) : The code to evaluate the reliable and clear of HVSR's peak from the Geopsy output. This was built using Python
