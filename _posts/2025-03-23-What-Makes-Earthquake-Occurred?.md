An earthquake is natural phenomenon that the ground is shaking suddenly. The ground shaking of an earthquake is caused by a collision or friction between two tectonic plates or planes. In this world, there are a lot of tectonic plates that move to each other with relative velocity rate ([1](http://www.geology.wisc.edu/~chuck/MORVEL/)). The asthenosphere is responsible to the movement of plate because the material composition is more fluid than lithosphere.

A high density plate will hit a low density plate within certain time period. In a certain time, this process will create a lock zone where the plates is difficult to move. An energy which produced from this process will be stored for a certain time until the energy of tectonic plate exceed its limit, then the energy will release in terms of earthquake in this zone.

The earthquake energy generates a vibration to any direction from subsurface to surface. This vibration is recorded by using three components seismometer. The vibration is then called as earthquake waveform. By using the waveform data, the earthquake location, magnitude, depth, and mechanism can be derived.
