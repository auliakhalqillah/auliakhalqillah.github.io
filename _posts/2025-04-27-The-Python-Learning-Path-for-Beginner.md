Python is one of the programming languages that has been widely used in this era. Its application in the machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence make Python more famous in this century. In April 2025, Python is at the first position programming languages based on [TIOBE index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/python/), this is the highest position since 2001. There are many chances to learn the Python with a bunches of learning materials on the internet or physical books. Are you ready to learn Python?

## What Does Python Offers?

**Easy to Learn**
Python is easy to be learned. Since the readability of the language is "like" human languange, it perfect programming language for the beginer level who want to take a programming course.

**Diversity**
By using Python, we can create any technology development, such as web application, mobile application, desktop application, and also take a part into any science field, like a data science.

**Library Support**
Python has a lot libraries or packages that can used for supproting your development code either from built-in Python or third-party library. The common third-party library can be found on the [PyPi](https://pypi.org/), the Python Package Index or you can found a particular package from any online repository, like GitHub or GitLab.

**Interpreted language**
The Python code is executed line by line, so it makes debugging more easier. We do not need to compile entire code.

**Open Source and Free**
This is the important things that the Python is an open source programming language platform. You can write your own code and share to any community platform to make collaboration.

## Why Do You Want to Learn Programming?
First, you must know the purpose of why you should learn programming either using Python or any programming languages? What kind a problems do you want to solve using programming? Do you want to solve general problems or specific problems? Who will use your code or program then? Once you map all of these, you will easier to create a path to learn programming.

For an example, you see a grocery store that sells many products. The store still using manual database store (a catalog book) and transaction process (only using a usual calculator) to account a total purchase from the consumer. For the owner, it is a regurel process that they have been through for a long time ago. They evaluate the remainig goods once a week and make a short report manually. For your perspective, it will take a long time process to create all these manually. You probably think that if there is any system that make all of these process can be done by systmetically and automatically, it will be organized more efficient and clear. So, you can create this system through programming. Nowadays, this system is know as Point of Sales (POS).

In this point, you want to solve the problem in the grocery store and it is a general problem. Finally, your system will be used by any owner grocery store. This is can be developed by using Python programming language.

In general, programming is used to solve a problem in every single context in this life and to help the people for their task.

## You Must Know This
For the beginner, you must know the following fundamental programming aspects in Python:

1. **Variable Type**: There are four variabel types, such as integer, float, string, and complex.
2. **Data Type**: There are three built-in data types which are used in Python, such as list, tuple, and distionary.
3. **Control Flow**: There are two control flows in programming, iteration (looping) and logical statement (if and else). These are the important part of the programming.
4. **Function**: This is a block of code that can be used for specified task.

You can read the short introduction for this from my note of [Basic Python](https://notes.auliakhalqillah.com/en/latest/Basic%20Python.html). Just keep in practice.
